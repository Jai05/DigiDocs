# DigiDocs

Problem Statement: Whenever we have to apply to some university or college for admission or to a company for hiring process, we have to share our education documents, degree documents, marks sheets etc etc. Most of the time we are asked for attested documents. For doing so first we have to take print outs or xerox copies off all the documents and have to get them attested from a gazzetted officer or notary public. Since, there is so much corruption in the government bodies, we all have to pay fee(bribe) to get the documents attested.

If we are applying online, then again we have to scan those attested copies, and share with the admission cell or future employer.

If you see here, we are first De-Digitising the documents and then digitising them again, for just getting attestation by paying bribe to government officials or notary. There is so much of hassel, waste of paper and money. To counter this problem I have come up with the idea of creating a digital library called DigiDocs, where we can upload the documents online, get them approved, and share them with the required personnel in a secure manner to avoid misuse and forgery. All this to be governed by an authorized body.

DigiDocs is a Pilot project of a web application to store documents online. It will have 2 modules: user and admin
The users can register and upload their documents in a repository.
The admin have to review those documents to be genuine and approve them.
Once the documents are approved, they will be pushed to the digitally secured library maintained under the unique Id of the user.
